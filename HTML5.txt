HSemantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain.

In summary, while you can use the <img> tag alone to display an image, the <figure> tag adds semantic value, improves accessibility, and makes it easier to style images with associated captions.

In summary, <article> is more focused on representing a standalone, independent piece of content, while <section> is used for grouping related content together within a document.
